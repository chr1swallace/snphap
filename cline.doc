Some notes on command line parsing
----------------------------------

The functions in the "cline" package implement a slightly extended version of
standard Unix command line parsing.

Command lines are first parsed into a series of words, separated by blank
space. The first word on a line is taken as the command name.

Subsequent words may be flags, values, or arguments. Additionally the
standard operators to redirect standard input and output streams are 
supported.

Flags start with the character '-' (minus). The value taken by the flag 
(if any) may directly follow the flag name with no separating blanks. 
Otherwise it will be assumed to be contained in the following word on the 
command line.

Anything which is not a flag is taken to be an argument. Order of arguments
is generally significant. An absent argument can be indicated by the single 
character '.' (period or full-stop).
